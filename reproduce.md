Copy your music by running these commands:

  python dags/scripts/youtube_elt.py
  ```
- You will be redirected, select your account
- Click `Continue`
- Click `Continue` again

### Last tips
Don't like the result? You can easily remove all playlists, tracks and albums, specify `REMOVE_AFTER` variable in `.env` file in format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`. If not specified, your entire Spotify library will be deleted! Caveat: `REMOVE_AFTER` doesn't affect playlists, i.e. all playlists will be removed (Spotify API doesn't support `added_at` field for playlists).
```
python dags/scripts/spotify_remove_playlists.py
python dags/scripts/spotify_unlike_albums.py
python dags/scripts/spotify_unlike_tracks.py
```

MusicFlow will cache any video it finds and assign it to a Spotify album, playlist or track. If an error occurs, you don't have to wait for MusicFlow to find the same music again. Just restart the flow.
